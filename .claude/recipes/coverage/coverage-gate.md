### Coverage Gate

Enforce minimum coverage threshold before release:

```bash
# Example: Jest coverage with threshold
npx jest --coverage --coverageThreshold='{"global":{"branches":80,"functions":80,"lines":80,"statements":80}}'

# Example: nyc check-coverage
nyc check-coverage --lines 80 --functions 80 --branches 80
```

**If coverage drops below threshold, STOP the release.**
