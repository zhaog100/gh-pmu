Assign issues to a branch.

Run the assign-branch script:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/shared/assign-branch.js "$ARGUMENTS"
```

## Handling "NO_BRANCH_FOUND" Output

If the script outputs `NO_BRANCH_FOUND`, it means no open branches exist. The script will also output:

1. **CONTEXT:** - Information about last version, issue labels, user input
2. **SUGGESTIONS:** - Formatted as `number|branch|description`

When you see this output:

1. Parse the SUGGESTIONS lines to extract branch options
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user select a branch:
   - Present options with the `(recommended)` one first
   - Include descriptions to help user decide
   - "Other" option allows custom branch name
3. After user selects, create the branch:
   ```bash
   gh pmu branch start --name "<selected-branch>"
   ```
4. Then re-run the original assign-branch command with the new branch

## Example Flow

Script output:
```
NO_BRANCH_FOUND
SUGGESTIONS:
1|patch/v0.15.1|Next patch version (bug fixes only) (recommended)
2|release/v0.16.0|Next minor version (new features)
```

Claude should:
1. Use AskUserQuestion with options: "patch/v0.15.1 (Recommended)", "release/v0.16.0"
2. User selects → run `gh pmu branch start --name "patch/v0.15.1"`
3. Re-run original command to complete assignment

## Normal Output

If branches exist, report the result to the user directly.
