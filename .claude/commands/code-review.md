# /code-review
Performs methodical, charter-aligned code review with manifest-driven incremental tracking. Previously reviewed unchanged files are skipped.
**Note:** Reviews **source code files** only. Use `/review-issue`, `/review-prd`, `/review-proposal`, or `/review-test-plan` for other artifacts.
## Prerequisites
- `CHARTER.md` exists and is configured (run `/charter` if missing)
- `framework-config.json` exists in project root
## Arguments
| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| *(none)* | | Normal incremental mode -- skip approved+unchanged files |
| `--full` | | Bypass manifest, review all discovered files |
| `--status` | | Report manifest statistics only, then STOP |
| `--scope <globs>` | | Comma-separated file patterns to limit scope |
| `--batch <N>` | | Review N files then stop; next run picks up where left off |
| `--with <domains>` | | Comma-separated domain extensions or `--with all` |
Multiple flags can be combined: `--scope "src/**/*.js" --batch 10 --with security`
## Execution Instructions
**REQUIRED:** Before executing:
1. **Generate Todo List:** Parse workflow steps, use `TodoWrite` to create todos
2. **Track Progress:** Mark todos `in_progress` -> `completed` as you work
3. **Post-Compaction:** If resuming after context compaction, re-read this spec and regenerate todos
## Workflow
### Step 1: Parse Arguments
Accept: no arguments (incremental), `--full`, `--status`, `--scope "globs"`, `--batch N`, `--with domains`
If invalid arguments provided, report error and STOP.
### Step 2: Load Manifest
Read `.code-review-manifest.json` from project root.
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "lastRun": "2026-02-16",
  "charter": { "contentHash": "sha256:abc123..." },
  "files": {
    "src/utils/helper.js": {
      "contentHash": "sha256:def456...",
      "status": "approved",
      "reviewedAt": "2026-02-15",
      "findingCount": 0,
      "findings": [],
      "issueRefs": [],
      "domains": []
    }
  }
}
```
**Status values:** `pending` (never reviewed), `approved` (clean), `flagged` (has findings), `deferred` (user skipped)
If manifest not found: create empty manifest (first run). If malformed: warn and continue as `--full`.
### Step 2b: Status Report (--status)
If `--status` flag: read manifest, run discovery for counting only, report approved count, flagged count, pending count, deferred count, and new (unreviewed) count. Show directory breakdown if > 20 files. **STOP** after report.
### Step 3: Discover Source Files
Scan codebase using Glob patterns. Auto-detect from charter tech stack:
- JS/TS: `**/*.js`, `**/*.ts`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.tsx`; Python: `**/*.py`; Go: `**/*.go`; Rust: `**/*.rs`; Java: `**/*.java`
**Default include patterns** (auto-detect from charter tech stack). **Default exclude patterns:**
`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.git/`, `vendor/`, `__pycache__/`, `coverage/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`
- Test files (reviewed by `/bad-test-review` instead)
If `--scope` provided: use those globs instead of defaults. Still apply excludes.
**Language detection:** 1. Check CHARTER.md tech stack 2. Scan root configs 3. Count extensions
### Step 4: Filter by Manifest (Incremental Mode)
Compute SHA-256 per file and compare against manifest:
| File State | Manifest Entry | Hash Match? | Action |
|------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| New file | Not in manifest | N/A | **Queue** |
| Existing | `approved` | Yes | **Skip** |
| Existing | `approved` | No | **Queue** re-review |
| Existing | `flagged` | Yes (unchanged) | **Skip** — flagged unchanged |
| Existing | `flagged` | No (changed) | **Queue** re-review |
| Existing | `deferred` | Any | **Skip** |
| Deleted | In manifest | N/A | **Remove** from manifest |
**Charter change:** If CHARTER.md hash differs, re-review all files.
**Domain change:** When `--with` specified, files previously approved without requested domain are queued for re-review even if unchanged.
**`--full` mode:** Queue every discovered file.
### Step 5: Load Charter-Aligned Review Criteria
Read `CHARTER.md` for project goals, conventions, quality standards, tech stack, security requirements.
| Category | What to Check |
|----------|--------------|
| **Correctness** | Logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one, null handling |
| **Security** | Injection, XSS, auth bypass, sensitive data exposure, OWASP top 10 |
| **Maintainability** | Complexity, duplication, coupling, cohesion, readability |
| **Naming conventions** | Variable/function/file naming per charter standards |
| **Error handling** | Missing try/catch, unhandled promises, silent failures |
| **Documentation** | Missing JSDoc/docstrings for public APIs (per charter requirements) |
### Step 5b: Skill Loading
Check `projectSkills` in `framework-config.json`. Re-read `.claude/metadata/skill-keywords.json` from disk and match keywords:
| Skill | Domain | When Loaded |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `anti-pattern-analysis` | Code smells, design pattern violations | Reviewing implementation files |
| `error-handling-patterns` | Error handling consistency | Error handling patterns detected |
| `codebase-analysis` | Architecture review, structural analysis | Reviewing module boundaries |
| `test-writing-patterns` | Test quality, assertion patterns | Reviewing test-adjacent files |
Skills loaded lazily. Supplementary, not required.
### Step 5c: Domain Extension Loading (--with)
If `--with` specified:
1. Read `.claude/metadata/review-extensions.json` registry
2. Parse: `all` loads all 8 extensions, comma-separated loads specific ones
3. Call `loadCodeReviewExtensions(projectDir, domainIds)` from `.claude/scripts/shared/lib/load-review-extensions.js`
4. For each domain: extract **Code Review Questions** section from criteria file
5. Unknown IDs: warn with available list (`security, accessibility, performance, chaos, contract, qa, seo, privacy`)
**Error handling:** All errors fall back to standard review only (non-blocking): unknown ID warns and skips, missing criteria file skips domain, missing registry falls back, no Code Review Questions section skips domain.
If `--with` not specified: skip extension loading.
### Step 6: Per-File Review
Read each queued file and perform structured analysis:
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| File path | Relative path |
| Line range | Start-end lines |
| Category | correctness, security, maintainability, naming, error-handling, documentation, or domain name |
| Severity | `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` |
| Description | What the issue is |
| Recommendation | How to fix it |
**Severity:** High = security/correctness bug; Medium = maintainability/convention; Low = style/naming; Info = suggestion
When `--with` active: after standard review, apply domain criteria questions. Tag findings with domain name. Domain findings can escalate but not downgrade severity.
### Step 7: Batch Mode Support
`--batch N`: limit to N files per invocation, save manifest after batch, report progress.
### Step 8: Structured Report
Save to `Construction/Code-Reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-report.md`. Format: summary, findings grouped by severity, per-file status, aggregate statistics.
### Step 9: Issue Creation
| Finding Type | Issue Command |
|-------------|---------------|
| Correctness/security defect | `/bug` |
| Missing error handling, refactoring, convention | `/enhancement` |
1. Present findings summary
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` for user choice: per finding, per group, or skip
3. Group related findings sharing root cause
4. Record issue refs in manifest
**Info-level findings** reported but not offered as issues.
### Step 9b: Security Finding Label
If `--with security` or `--with all` was specified and any security domain finding has ⚠️ or ❌ severity, apply the `security-finding` label to each issue created from security findings:
```bash
gh issue edit $ISSUE --add-label=security-finding
```
If all security findings are ✅ (no issues detected), do not apply the label.
### Step 10: Manifest Update
1. Write updated `.code-review-manifest.json`
2. Update `charter.contentHash`
3. Set status: no findings -> `approved`, has findings -> `flagged`
4. Record `reviewedAt` and `findingCount` per file
5. Record `domains` array when `--with` active (merge, don't replace)
6. Preserve skipped entries; remove deleted entries
### Step 11: Final Summary
```
Code Review Complete
--------------------
Files reviewed: N
Findings: X (H high, M medium, L low, I info)
Issues created: Y
Report: Construction/Code-Reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-report.md
Manifest: .code-review-manifest.json updated
Next: Run --status to see cumulative progress
```
**STOP** -- command complete.
## Error Handling

| Manifest malformed | "Manifest corrupted. Running full review." -> continue as `--full` |
| Source file unreadable | Warn and skip, continue |
| Issue creation fails | Warn, include in report, continue |
| `--scope` matches no files | "Scope pattern matched no files: {pattern}" -> STOP |
| `framework-config.json` missing | Warn, continue without skill loading |
