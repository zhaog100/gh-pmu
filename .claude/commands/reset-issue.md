# /reset-issue
Reset a bug, enhancement, PRD, or proposal issue to a clean slate. Removes review artifacts, resolutions, test plans, and associated downstream files.

---

## Prerequisites
- `gh pmu` extension installed
- `.gh-pmu.json` configured in repository root

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `#issue` | Yes | Issue number to reset (e.g., `#42` or `42`) |
| `--dry-run` | No | Preview actions without executing |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Issue Type

Fetch the issue and check labels:

```bash
gh pmu view $ISSUE --json=number,title,labels,body,state
```

**Allowed labels:** `bug`, `enhancement`, `prd`, `proposal`
**Rejected:** `story`, `epic`, `branch`, or any other type

**If rejected:**
```
Error: /reset-issue only applies to bug, enhancement, prd, and proposal issues.
Issue #$ISSUE has label "$LABEL" which is not supported.
```
→ **STOP**

### Step 2: Analyze Reset Scope

Parse the issue to determine what will be reset:

| Item | Detection |
|------|-----------|
| AC checkboxes | Count `[x]` boxes in body |
| Reviews counter | Parse `**Reviews:** N` from body |
| Auto-generated sections | Find `#### Proposed Solution`, `#### Proposed Fix` |
| Review comments | Query issue comments for `## Issue Review`, `## Proposal Review`, `## PRD Review` patterns |
| `reviewed` label | Check labels array |
| Test plan files | Search `Construction/Test-Plans/` for files referencing `#$ISSUE` |

**For proposal issues additionally:**
| Item | Detection |
|------|-----------|
| Associated PRD issue | Parse body for PRD issue reference (`PRD: #N` or `PRD/{name}/PRD-{name}.md`) |
| PRD converted to backlog | Check if PRD issue has sub-issues in `in_progress`/`in_review`/`done` |

### Step 3: Dry-Run or Confirmation

**If `--dry-run`:**
```
Dry run — /reset-issue #$ISSUE

Would reset:
  - Uncheck $N AC checkboxes
  - Reset Reviews counter (currently $N)
  - Remove $N auto-generated sections
  - Delete $N review comments
  - Remove 'reviewed' label: $YES_NO
  - Delete $N test plan files
  [proposal only]
  - Delete PRD issue #$PRD_NUM: $YES_NO
  - Delete PRD files: $FILE_LIST

No changes made.
```
→ **STOP**

**If not dry-run:**
Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
```
This will reset issue #$ISSUE ($TITLE):
  - Uncheck $N AC checkboxes
  - Reset Reviews counter
  - Delete $N review comments
  - Remove 'reviewed' label
  - Delete $N test plan files
  [proposal-specific items if applicable]

Proceed with reset?
```

**If user declines:** → **STOP**

### Step 4: Execute Reset

Perform actions in order:

**4a: Reset issue body**
```bash
gh pmu view $ISSUE --body-stdout > .tmp-$ISSUE.md
```
- Replace all `[x]` with `[ ]`
- Replace `**Reviews:** N` with `**Reviews:** 0`
- Remove `#### Proposed Solution` section (if auto-generated)
- Remove `#### Proposed Fix` section (if auto-generated)

```bash
gh pmu edit $ISSUE -F .tmp-$ISSUE.md && rm .tmp-$ISSUE.md
```

**4b: Move to backlog**
```bash
gh pmu move $ISSUE --status backlog
```

**4c: Delete review comments**
Query comments and delete those matching review patterns:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$ISSUE/comments --paginate
```
For each comment matching `## Issue Review`, `## Proposal Review`, or `## PRD Review`:
```bash
gh api -X DELETE repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID
```

**4d: Remove reviewed label**
```bash
gh issue edit $ISSUE --remove-label reviewed
```
(Skip silently if label not present)

**4e: Delete test plan files**
For each test plan file in `Construction/Test-Plans/` that references `#$ISSUE`:
```bash
git rm "$FILE"
```

**4f: Proposal — PRD cleanup**
If issue has `proposal` label and an associated PRD:
- **If PRD NOT converted to backlog:** Delete PRD issue and files
  ```bash
  gh issue close $PRD_ISSUE --comment "Deleted by /reset-issue #$ISSUE"
  gh pmu move $PRD_ISSUE --status done
  git rm -r "PRD/{name}/"
  ```
- **If PRD converted to backlog:** Warn and ask user
  ```
  Warning: PRD #$PRD_NUM has $N backlog issues in progress.
  Deleting the PRD will orphan these issues.

  Options:
  1. Keep PRD (only reset the proposal)
  2. Delete PRD and orphan backlog issues
  3. Cancel reset
  ```

### Step 5: Commit Changes

If any files were deleted (test plans, PRD files):
```bash
git commit -m "Refs #$ISSUE — reset issue artifacts (test plans, PRD files)"
```

### Step 6: Post Audit Comment

```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE --body "Issue reset by /reset-issue on $DATE. Removed: $N review comments, $M test plan files. Status: backlog."
```

### Step 7: Report Completion

```
Reset complete: Issue #$ISSUE — $TITLE

Actions taken:
  ✓ AC checkboxes unchecked ($N)
  ✓ Reviews counter reset to 0
  ✓ Auto-generated sections removed ($N)
  ✓ Review comments deleted ($N)
  ✓ 'reviewed' label removed
  ✓ Test plan files deleted ($M)
  ✓ Status: backlog
  ✓ Audit comment posted

Issue is ready for a fresh start.
```

**STOP.**
